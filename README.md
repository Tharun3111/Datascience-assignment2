#In this report, we're going to look at two different things. First, we're going to check out how popular Steven S. Skiena's books are on Amazon. Amazon tells us how well books are selling by giving them a rank. The lower the number, the more people are buying the book. We're going to use a special computer program to collect this ranking information for each of Skiena's books.

#then, we're going to switch gears and talk about sports. We'll pick a sport and find all the historical data we can about its players. With this information, we're going to create a way to figure out who the best players are. We'll look at what makes a player good at their position and come up with a system to rank them. This might be based on things like how many goals they score in soccer or their batting average in baseball.

#After collecting data, we're going to create some charts and graphs to show what we've found. This will help us to see which are of Skiena's books that could be the best one to buy next and tells us which players in a sport are the best. We'll also talk about what we have learned from doing this and how we might be able to do it even better next time.
